# ES6 Basics:

- ES6 was a 2015 update to JavaScript that significantly expanded the capabilities of the language.

- let and const were added for variable declarations, replacing var. let and const allow for block-scoping. let is used for variables that can be reassigned while const is used for constant variables.

- Arrow functions replaced the this keyword and are a concise way to perform simple functions. e.g. const add = (a, b) => a + b;

- Template literals using backticks allow for variables to be easily placed inside of strings.

- ES6 added the ability to use modules to seperate files and import/export functionality between them.

- Computed property names allow users to dynamically compute the property name. This is done using square brackets e.g. [functionName]

- ES6 allows method properties to be defined as methodName() {} rather than methodName: function() {}.

- in ES6, an iterator is an object that provides a way to access the elements of a collection, e.g. an array or set. .next() can be used to iterate through the collection and the boolean 'done' can be used to check whether the end of the array has been reached.
