# ES6 Classes

- All ES6 classes use a method named constructor(). Attributes or properties can declared in the constructor and stored in public or private variables using this.propertyName = propertyName or this._propertyName = propertyName, respectively.

- new instances of classes can be created using the 'new' keyword:
newInstance = new ClassName;

- JS does not support abstract classes but an abstract class can effectively be created by throwing errors in the constructor of a class.
